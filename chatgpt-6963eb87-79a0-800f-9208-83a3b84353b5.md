## User Prompts

> So, I’d like to build my resume out that shows I know how to build apis, build event driven processing such as using a pubsub subscriptions and kubernetes processors, create live application databases, and analyticcal transformations.
>
> I’d like to demonstrate that I can manage all this using Iaac using terraform, helm, and Argo. Including managing the security using terraform to create and provision service accounts and permissions.
>
> But importantly: GCP doesn’t offer theses toolings on their free tier.
>
> What is the most cost effective way to demonstrate theses skills? Is there anyway to get free tier for the compute necessary to host apis and pubsub and cloud sql and bucket storage on GCP?
>
> Could I minimize my cost to make it less than $10/month?
>
> If not could I use a different provider where I could do so this for less than $10/month?

---

> What’s a good very simple app idea that can demonstrate common business needs.

---

> Yes. Sketch me a full blue print. Lets use aws since I’ve not used the free tier for the year so I could use a whole year of free tier to demonstrate my skills.

---

> I have almost no front end experience. What would be best to make an almost cookie cutter front end that I don’t have to know much about to get it to work with the backend?

---

> With aws and GitHub. Can I do oidc connectivity on the GitHub actions to make sure to maximize the aws configuration being done over a terraform cr aged service accounts ?
>
> I’d like to have a very very minimal “bootstrap” script that I run as my personal user (owner/super admin) to provision the first service accounts, and then have all further code go through GitHub actions.

---

> In GitHub, how many repos can I have for free? And how much GitHub actions can I use for free connecting to aws?

---

> Under aws, can I set my account to use free tier only and cause resources to shutdown/reject rather than bill?

---

> Is there a cloud provider that could demonstrate what I want, had oidc support for GitHub actions connectivity, and has the ability to hard cap at free tier to prevent billing? Oracle? Azure?

---

> I’d like to also demonstrate having terraform code create GitHub repos, and separate the examples into separate repos to demonstrate how different repos would fall under different organizational responsibilities.

---

Offhand I can think of:
- a repo that create GitHub repos, and manages their settings
- a repo for the creating service accounts and other permissions , and granting workload identity or oidc access to tie GitHub actions on some repos to specific service accounts.
- a repo to define the front end, and upload it somewhere in aws
- a repo for the network configuration to control some sub domain to the single page application front end.
- a repo for the backend serverless api.
- a repo for some reporting use case of some kind.

## ChatGPT Response (Summary)

Here’s a structured approach for separating your project into multiple repos while demonstrating Terraform/IaC skills, GitHub OIDC, organizational responsibility, and a full cloud workflow:

### 1) Repo Structure & Responsibilities

| Repo | Responsibility | Terraform Resources | Resume Value |
|------|---------------|--------------------|-------------|
| github-org-infra | Manage GitHub repos, teams, branch protections, secrets | github_repository, github_team, github_branch_protection, github_actions_secret | Shows GitHub repo creation, branching policies, org-level configuration, and automated repo setup |
| iam-oidc-permissions | Manage AWS IAM roles, policies, OIDC trust for GitHub Actions | aws_iam_role, aws_iam_policy, aws_iam_role_policy_attachment, OIDC trust | Secure GitHub Actions integration with AWS, multi-repo separation, least privilege, Terraform automation |
| frontend-app | Define front-end app, build & deploy static assets | SPA template (React Admin, Appsmith, or static HTML), aws_s3_bucket, aws_cloudfront_distribution | Static app deployment, IaC for storage & CDN, automated build/deploy pipeline |
| network-config | Configure DNS, subdomain, routing | aws_route53_zone, aws_route53_record, CloudFront/API Gateway domain mapping | Network infra separation, multi-team/domain management, infrastructure modularization |
| backend-api | Define serverless API | aws_lambda_function, aws_api_gateway_rest_api, aws_dynamodb_table, aws_sns_topic, DynamoDB Streams | Serverless API design, event-driven processing, backend IaC, integration with OIDC roles |
| reporting-analytics | Reporting & data transformation pipelines | S3 bucket or DynamoDB for analytics, Lambda/Step Functions, QuickSight/CSV | Analytics pipeline, modular deployment, event-driven transforms, infrastructure separation |

---

### 2) GitHub Action / OIDC Flow for Multi-Repo Design

- Each repo has its own GitHub Actions workflow.
- The OIDC IAM role for each repo can be scoped differently:
	- `frontend-app`: deploy S3 & CloudFront only
	- `backend-api`: create Lambda, DynamoDB, SNS only
	- `reporting-analytics`: read DynamoDB & write to S3 only
- Terraform runs in each repo → assumes the role via OIDC → performs only permitted actions.
- Repo separation demonstrates organizational responsibility, least privilege, multi-team CI/CD workflows.

---

### 3) Example Dependency & Execution Order

1. github-org-infra: Creates the repos for other domains.
2. iam-oidc-permissions: Creates IAM roles & OIDC mappings after repos exist.
3. network-config: Deploy DNS/subdomain resources (needed before frontend can be served on a proper URL).
4. frontend-app: Build SPA & deploy to S3/CloudFront (uses subdomain from network-config).
5. backend-api: Deploy serverless API connected to DynamoDB & SNS (frontend can call endpoints).
6. reporting-analytics: Subscribes to backend events for analytics/reporting.

---

### 4) Benefits / Resume Narrative

- Multi-repo org management: Shows ability to separate responsibilities by repository, similar to enterprise setups.
- Terraform + OIDC: Shows secure, automated CI/CD pipelines with scoped permissions.
- Serverless + SPA + Network: Demonstrates end-to-end cloud platform engineering skills.
- Event-driven pipelines + analytics: Demonstrates backend processing + business reporting use cases.
- IaC modularity: Shows ability to maintain infrastructure as code in multiple independent modules.

---

### 5) Optional Enhancements

- Use Terraform modules for repeated patterns (e.g., Lambda + DynamoDB setup) to show professional code organization.
- GitHub Actions could trigger cross-repo runs using `workflow_run` events (e.g., backend-api deploy triggers reporting-analytics update).
- Add state backends (S3 + DynamoDB lock table) per repo to demonstrate enterprise-grade Terraform setup.

If you want, I can draw a visual diagram showing all 6 repos, their responsibilities, and the OIDC/Terraform CI/CD flow across AWS. This would be resume-ready to illustrate multi-repo enterprise-style infrastructure.
